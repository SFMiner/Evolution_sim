# Teacher's Guide - Evolution Simulator

## Lesson Plan Integration

### Grade Levels
- Middle School (Ages 11-14): Basic natural selection concepts
- High School (Ages 14-18): Detailed genetics and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
- College: Population genetics and evolutionary mechanisms

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
1. Explain how natural selection leads to adaptation
2. Describe the relationship between genotype and phenotype
3. Predict how allele frequencies change under selection pressure
4. Understand how recessive alleles persist in populations
5. Interpret genetic frequency data and graphs

## Suggested Activities

### Activity 1: Predator-Prey Dynamics (30 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Start with Clean Tree Bark (light background)
- Initial population has mixed light and dark moths

**Procedure:**
1. Students predict which moths will be easier to catch
2. Run 5 generations, recording data after each
3. Switch to Sooty Tree Bark environment
4. Run 5 more generations with new survivors

**Discussion:**
- How did the population change in each environment?
- What happened to allele frequencies?
- Why didn't all dark/light moths disappear immediately?
- How does this relate to Industrial Revolution peppered moths?

### Activity 2: Heterozygous Advantage (20 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Choose any habitat
- Focus on genotype frequencies (AA, Aa, aa)

**Procedure:**
1. Observe initial 1:2:1 ratio (approximately)
2. Run multiple generations
3. Track how Aa genotypes maintain diversity

**Discussion:**
- Why do heterozygotes (Aa) look like dominant homozygotes (AA)?
- How do recessive alleles "hide" from selection?
- What would happen if we could see genotypes instead of phenotypes?
- Real-world example: Sickle cell trait in malaria regions

### Activity 3: Comparative Evolution (45 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Divide class into groups
- Each group runs a different habitat

**Procedure:**
1. Each group runs 10 generations
2. Groups record:
   - Generation when population becomes well-adapted
   - Final allele frequencies
   - Number of generations to reach stable frequencies
3. Groups present findings

**Discussion:**
- Did all habitats evolve at the same rate?
- Which backgrounds allowed fastest adaptation? Why?
- How does initial genetic diversity affect evolution speed?

### Activity 4: Environmental Change (25 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Start with one flower color habitat
- Run 5 generations

**Procedure:**
1. Record adapted population's allele frequencies
2. Switch to opposite flower color (yellow → pink or vice versa)
3. Run 5 more generations without resetting population
4. Observe adaptation to new environment

**Discussion:**
- How quickly can populations adapt to environmental change?
- What happened to previously advantageous alleles?
- Why might some organisms go extinct during rapid change?
- Connection to climate change and habitat loss

## Data Collection Worksheets

### Generation Data Table

| Generation | Population Size | % Caught | Dominant Allele % | Recessive Allele % | AA % | Aa % | aa % |
|------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------|------|------|
| 1          |                |          |                   |                   |      |      |      |
| 2          |                |          |                   |                   |      |      |      |
| 3          |                |          |                   |                   |      |      |      |
| ...        |                |          |                   |                   |      |      |      |

### Analysis Questions

1. **Observation**: Describe what happened to the population's appearance over 5 generations.

2. **Explanation**: Why did organisms with certain colors survive better?

3. **Prediction**: If we continued for 20 generations, what would happen to:
   - Dominant allele frequency?
   - Recessive allele frequency?
   - Poorly camouflaged organisms?

4. **Application**: How does this simulation model real evolution? What is oversimplified?

## Common Student Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Evolution is random"
**Correction**: While mutations are random, natural selection is non-random. Better-adapted organisms survive at higher rates.

### Misconception 2: "Evolution happens to individuals"
**Correction**: Individuals don't evolve—their traits don't change. Populations evolve as allele frequencies shift.

### Misconception 3: "Recessive alleles always disappear"
**Correction**: Heterozygotes (Aa) carry recessive alleles without expressing them, maintaining genetic diversity.

### Misconception 4: "Evolution requires many generations"
**Correction**: With strong selection, populations can adapt rapidly (as seen in simulation).

### Misconception 5: "Organisms try to adapt"
**Correction**: Organisms don't "try" to change. Random variation + selection = adaptation.

## Extension Activities

### Advanced: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Calculate expected frequencies under no selection:
- p² + 2pq + q² = 1
- Compare to simulation results
- Discuss why simulation deviates (selection pressure)

### Cross-Curricular: Math/Statistics

- Graph allele frequencies vs. generation
- Calculate rate of change
- Linear regression analysis
- Statistical significance tests

### Writing Assignment

"Write a newspaper article explaining how the peppered moth evolved during the Industrial Revolution. Use data from your simulation to support your explanation."

### Research Project

Compare simulation results to actual case studies:
- Peppered moths (Biston betularia)
- Pocket mice coat color in Arizona
- Antibiotic resistance in bacteria
- Darwin's finches beak sizes

## Assessment Ideas

### Formative Assessment
- Exit ticket: "Explain in 3 sentences how allele frequencies changed and why"
- Think-pair-share: Predict outcomes before each generation
- Whiteboard responses: Sketch expected graph shapes

### Summative Assessment
- Lab report with data, graphs, and analysis
- Presentation comparing different habitats
- Written exam with simulation screenshots as prompts
- Design your own organism/habitat combination

## Technical Tips

### Running the Simulation
- **Best practice**: Let students work in pairs (one "predator", one recorder)
- **Time management**: Each full activity takes ~5-10 generations (10-15 minutes of catching)
- **Multiple trials**: Run each scenario 2-3 times to see variation

### Troubleshooting
- **"Population died out"**: This can happen! Discuss extinction events
- **"Not much change"**: May need stronger selection (catch more organisms)
- **"Too fast"**: Can adjust time per round in settings

### Modifications for Different Levels

**Simplified (Middle School)**:
- Focus on phenotype changes only
- Skip detailed genotype analysis
- Emphasize survival = reproduction

**Standard (High School)**:
- Full genetic analysis
- Calculate frequencies
- Predict next generation

**Advanced (AP/College)**:
- Hardy-Weinberg calculations
- Selection coefficient estimation
- Genetic drift vs. selection

## Real-World Connections
